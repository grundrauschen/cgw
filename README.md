## Configuration
### VXLAN

There are two different ways available of connecting this service with another container.

The first one is the manual way, where the partners have to be configured with values.
The second one is using the *vxlan-controller* and the vxlans can be configured using annotations.

#### manual VXLAN setup

VXLAN endpoints inside the CGW can be created by adding a configuration under the `vxlan` key.

For example:

```yaml
vxlan:
  enabled: true
  connectors:
    - name: conn1
      peer: <ip or fqdn of peer>
      bridge: true
      id: 42
      ipaddr: <ip address added to the created interface>
      # mandatory when bridge: true
      # if multiple interfaces shall be bridged,
      # add them as a space seperated list
      bridged_ifaces: eth1
      # bridged_ifaces: "eth1 eth2 net0"
      bridge_name: <name of bridge> # optional: defaults to br0      
```

Multiple interfaces can be added by adding more entries to the list of connectors.
`enabled` has to be explicitly set.

#### VXLAN-Controller configuration

To use the *vxlan-controller* add the following section to the configuration:

```yaml
vxlanController:
  enabled: true
  names: "vxeth0, vxeth1"
  ip:
  - interface: vxeth1
    addr: "192.0.2.1/24"
    type: ip
  - interface: bridge0
    type: bridge
    bind:
      - gre9
      - vxeth0
  - interface: gre9
    type: interface
    action: up
  staticRoutes:
  - "203.0.113.15 via 192.0.2.1" 
  - "203.0.113.16 via 192.0.2.1"
```

The networks have to be configured already by the controller and have to be provided as a comma seperated
list (`vxlanController.names`).

The `vxlanController.ip` section can be provided by a list of configurations.
Three types are available. One for assigning a static IP address to an interface, the second
to add a bridge and bind interfaces to them and the third to set interfaces to state `up` or `down`.

Additionally `vxlanController.staticRoutes` can be configured with a list of static routes as strings
to be configured in the default routing table of the pod.


### GRE

A GRE or GRETAP interface can be added for tunneling of IP or Ethernet traffic respectively.

For example:

```yaml
gre:
  enabled: true
  remoteip: <ip of remote host>
  localip: <local ip>
  # It is recommended to use a name different than `gre0`.
  # This might already have be added by loading a kernel module
  name: <name of the interface to be created>
  # if Ethernet traffic shall be tunneled,
  # a GRETAP interface has to be used instead of a GRE interface
  gretap: <true | false> 
```
  

### Monitoring

The monitoring component of *CGW* supports ICMP echoes to defined endpoints and exposes it via an
http endpoint in prometheus format.

By default the component will send pings to the address stated in `ipsec.remote_ping_endpoint` from the address
configured in `ipsec.local_ping_endpoint`.

A service will be exposed and will be scraped automatically by common configured prometheus instances.

By default the service will be called `<release name>-cgw` and the metrics will be available at
`http://<release name>-cgw:9427/metrics`

#### Configure targets

To configure additional targets or source addresses, you have to configure the values as follows:

```yaml
pingExporter:
  targets:
    - sourceV4: 192.0.2.1          # Source address of ICMP requests
      sourceV6: "2001:0DB8:1::1"   # Source address of ICMP requests
      pingInterval: 5s             # interval for ICMP requests
      pingTimeout: 4s              # timeout for ICMP requests
      pingTargets:                 # list of ICMP targets
        - 192.0.2.10
        - 198.51.100.1
    - sourceV4: 192.0.2.2
      sourceV6: "2001:0DB8:2::2"
      pingInterval: 5s
      pingTimeout: 4s
      pingTargets:
        - 203.0.113.1
        - "2001:0DB8:2::10"
```
All parameters are required!

When targets are set in this way, the usage of `ipsec.remote_ping_endpoint` and `ipsec.local_ping_endpoint` will
be automatically disabled.
